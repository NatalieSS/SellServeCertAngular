SellServeCert Landing Page

  What is it?
  -----------
  SellServeCert is a landing page and SPA for an imaginary alcohol server/bartender certification course company. This version is running on Node, Express, and Angular.

  The Latest Version
  ------------------
  This app was originally created with Node, Express, and JS/jQuery. This version has been updated with an Angular front end. Some aspects are still written in jQuery as there was no performance advantage to converting them fully to Angular.


  Installation
  ------------
  In order to run this app in a development state, be sure you have Node and Express installed on your workstation. Then simply navigate to the root folder of the app and run node server js in the terminal to start up the server. The page will then be accessible at localhost:8000.
